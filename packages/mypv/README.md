# my-PV device communication library

## Installation

```bash
pip install mypv

# If you want to use the HTTP interface
pip install mypv[http]
```

## Supported devices

I have only tested the AC-THOR device and specifically the CH edition.
If you own any my-PV device, please contact me. It should be easy to add support for it if you have
the device and can provide me with the necessary information.
